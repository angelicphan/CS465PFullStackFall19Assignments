I chosed http://placekitten.com/ for Exercise 2.

## Assignment 3

I utilized the following layouts: CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Bootstrap Grid. I did not do the optional Exercise 8.

## Assignment 6

The three tutorials I chosed to do were:

1. Intro to React -Reactjs.org: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
2. Mini Workshop 1 - Build a Simple Pet Fetching Web Application - Vue
   Vixens: https://workshops.vuevixens.org/workshop/minis/mini1.html

   - This was coded in codesandbox. I've downloaded the project folder but not the dependecies. My forked [project](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-template-ovnef) on codesandbox.

3. Build a Node.js Web App using Google Cloud Platform - Codelabs: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-app-engine-node/index.html?index=..%2F..index#1
